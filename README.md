## The project about

the great eagle tribute was final project back in 2019 when learning frontend web development at CodeSpace academy Cape Town.
This is a simple static website using HTML-CSS-JavaScripts.

The Task was to create a webpage talking about one person hero and the reason why one chose that hero. Many have chosen public figures, hence, I decided to go for something unusual. That is where the great bald eagle came from.
